Title: Beyond the Dividing Pie: Multi-Issue Bargaining in the Laboratory
Abstract: We design a laboratory experiment to study bargaining when parties need to agree on multiple  issues.   We  find  that  bundling—the  ability  to  make  price  offers  on  combinations of issues rather than separately—is critical for reaching agreement.  We also find that  giving  bargainers  access  to  more  information  about  each  other’s  valuations  and costs  does  not  raise  efficiency,  because  the  boost  in  agreement  rates  in  small-surplus negotiations  is  offset  by  increased  risk-taking  and  conflicting  fairness  preferences  in large-surplus negotiations.  Finally, we show that successful negotiations are characterized  by  an  alternating  offer  structure,  which  emerges  endogenously.   It  involves  offers that split the difference between the two most recent demands, and it displays a higher probability of agreement vis-a`-vis other formats of bargaining observed in our data.
