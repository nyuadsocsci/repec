Title: Competing for Proposal Rights: Theory and Experimental Evidence
Abstract: Competition for positions of power is a common practice in most organizations where decisions are reached through negotiations. We study theoretically and experimentally how differentvoting rules affect the incentives to compete for the right to propose a distribution of benefitsin a sequential bargaining game. Under the majority rule, players with a high chance of proposingare also more likely to be excluded from a coalition when not proposing, which dampensincentives to compete for proposal rights relative to the unanimity case where no one can beexcluded from a coalition. However, when rent-seeking efforts affect proposal rights only in thefirst bargaining round, equilibrium efforts to secure proposal rights are higher under the majorityrule because they no longer affect the likelihood of coalition exclusion. Our experimentalfindings uncover a novel efficiency trade-off absent in theory: While gridlock is stronger underunanimity, majoritarian bargaining elicits higher competition costs regardless of the durabilityof efforts in affecting proposal rights, rendering both rules equally efficient. The distribution ofbenefits is affected by the endogeneity of proposal rights contrary to behavioral expectations assubjects gravitate towards equitable sharing and proposers often do not keep the lionâ€™s share.Further experiments reveal that subject behavior is consistent with myopic reasoning and thatour results hold robustly in distinct subject samples.
