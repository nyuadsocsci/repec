Title: Measuring Preferences for Competition 
Abstract: Recent research has found that competitive behavior measured in experiments strongly predicts individual differences in educational and labor market outcomes. However, there isno consensus on the underlying factors behind competitive behavior in these experiments.Are participants who compete more capable, more confident, and more tolerant of risk,or are they competing because they enjoy competition per se? In this study, we presentan experiment designed to measure individuals’ preferences for competition. Comparedto previous work, our experiment rules out risk preferences by design, measures beliefsmore precisely, and allows us to measure the magnitude of preferences for competition. Inaddition, we collect multiple decisions per participant, which lets us evaluate the impact ofnoisy decision-making. We find strong evidence that many individuals possess preferencesfor competition. Most participants are either reliably competition-seeking or competition averse,and their choices are highly consistent with expected utility maximization. We alsofind that preferences for competition depend on the number of competitors but not on theparticipants’ gender.
