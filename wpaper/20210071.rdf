Title: Limited Strategic Thinking and the Cursed Match
Abstract: In  vertically  differentiated  matching  markets  with  private  information,  agents 
face  an  acceptance  curse:   being  accepted  as  a  partner  conveys  bad  news.   We experimentally investigate whether individuals anticipate the acceptance curse in such  an  environment.   We  test  the  effect  of  an  exogenous  change  in  reservation values  which,  by  making  some  types  more  selective,  induces  significant  changes   in the posterior distribution of match qualities.  Consistent with limited strategic sophistication, subjects do not respond to this manipulation.  Through additional investigation and structural estimations, we suggest a mechanism explaining the lack of subjectsâ€™ response:  out-of-equilibrium beliefs are quantitatively more important than limited conditional thinking.
