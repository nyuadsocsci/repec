Title: Asset Price Volatility and Investment Horizons: An Experimental Investigation
Abstract:We study the effects of the investment horizon on asset price volatilityusing a Learning to Forecast experiment. We find that, for short investmenthorizons, participants coordinate on self-fulfilling trend extrapolatingpredictions. Price deviations are then reinforced and amplified, possiblyleading to large bubbles and crashes in asset prices. For longer investmenthorizons such bubbles do not emerge and price volatility tends to be lower.This is due to the fact that, for longer horizons, there is more dispersion inparticipants' forecasts, and participants extrapolate trends in past prices toa lesser extent. We also show that, independent of the investment horizon,if the initial history of asset prices is already relatively stable before participantsstart their prediction task, price volatility remains small, with pricesclose to their fundamental values for the duration of the experiment.
