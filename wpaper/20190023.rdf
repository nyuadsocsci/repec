Title: The Economics of the Manila Galleon
Abstract: The Manila Galleon was a commercial route that existed from 1565 to 1815. It connected Asia and America through the Pacific Ocean. It was a fundamental step in the history of globalization. The objective of this essay is to offer an economic framework to interpret the existing evidence on the Manila Galleon. Based on this framework, the essay identifies that the Manila Galleon was only possible thanks to the coincidence of a quite singular set of international circumstances and favorable market conditions at the local level. Additionally, the essay explores the experience of New Granada as a way to highlight the large asymmetry in the role and impact of the Manila Galleon trade across regions.
