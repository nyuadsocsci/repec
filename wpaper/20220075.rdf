Title: Globalization
Abstract: This chapter written for the Oxford Handbook of Historical Political Economy argues that you cannot understand the history of globalization without taking political factors into account; andthat you cannot understand the history of comparative economic development without taking globalization into account. Globalization compels us to take geography seriously and to thinkmore like historians.
