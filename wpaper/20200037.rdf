Title: The Determinants of Multilateral Bargaining: A Comprehensive Analysis of Baron and Ferejohn Majoritarian Bargaining Experiments
Abstract: We collected and analyzed the data sets of all majoritarian Baron and Ferejohn(1989 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev.) experiments through 2018. By exploiting the variation of experimental parameters we are able to identify how group size, discount, voting weights, and institutional variables such as communication, affect the distribution ofthe surplus, proposer power, and agreement delay. We conduct the first structuralestimation of the proposer's share equilibrium prediction and find little support for thetheory. We also report on behavior following a disagreement and and strong evidenceof history-dependent strategies in the form of punishment toward failed proposers andtheir supporters.
