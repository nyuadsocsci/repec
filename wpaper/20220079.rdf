Title: Is There a Motherhood Gap in the Willingness to Compete for Pay?
Abstract: A substantial fraction of the gender gap in earnings is due to wage disparitiesbetween women with and without children. Inspired by evidence linking labor marketoutcomes with attitudes toward competition, we explore the associationbetween motherhood and the willingness to compete for pay. In two behavioralstudies, we find that mothers are considerably less likely to choose a competitivepayment scheme than similar women without children. Fathers are as willingto compete as non-fathers. The motherhood gap is not mediated by differencesin ability, beliefs, risk attitudes, marital status, parental education, parentalemployment, or the time since the last pregnancy.
