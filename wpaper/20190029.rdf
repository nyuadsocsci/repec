Title: Collaborative production networks among unequal actors
Abstract: We develop a model of strategic network formation in productive exchanges to analyze the consequences of an understudied but consequential form of heterogeneity: differences between actors in the form of their production functions. We also address how this interacts with resource heterogeneity. Some actors (e.g. start-up firms) may exhibit accelerating returns to investment in joint projects, while others (e.g. established firms) may face decelerating returns. We show that if there is a direct relation between acceleration and resources, actors form exchange networks segregated by type of production function. On the other hand, if there is an inverse relation between acceleration and resources, networks emerge allowing all types of actors to collaborate, especially high-resource decelerating actors with multiple low-resource accelerating actors.
